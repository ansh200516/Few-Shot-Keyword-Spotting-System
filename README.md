# Few Shot Language Agnostic Keyword Spotting (FSLAKWS)

ðŸ§  Overview

Few Shot Language Agnostic Keyword Spotting (FSLAKWS) is a machine learning framework that enables keyword detection across multiple languages using few-shot learning. It integrates audio preprocessing, Whisper embeddings, variational autoencoders (VAE), and a Streamlit UI for interactive keyword spotting.

This project is designed to support low-resource languages and domains with minimal labeled data. It includes robust augmentation strategies, audio embedding extraction, and a neural inference pipeline.
